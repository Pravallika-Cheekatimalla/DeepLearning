Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to run it:

Open a terminal: If you’re using a command line interface (like Terminal on macOS/Linux or Command Prompt/PowerShell on Windows), navigate to the directory where your test.py script is located.

Run the command: Replace $1 and $2 with the actual values you need. For example:
python test.py arg1 arg2

Replace arg1 and arg2 with the appropriate values. If you need to provide paths to files, make sure to include the full path or relative path to those files.

Check for errors: If the script runs but doesn’t behave as expected, check the output for any error messages that might indicate what went wrong.
